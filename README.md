Welcome to the SDG 2.2.2: Prevalence of Malnutrition Among Children aged 2 to 3 Years project!

This project aims to analyze the prevalence of malnutrition among children aged 2 to 3 years in different regions of the world. The Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) seeks to end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Malnutrition is a major public health problem, especially in low and middle-income countries, and it has long-term consequences for children's health and development.

In this project, we use R Studio to analyze and visualize data on malnutrition prevalence from different sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and other relevant databases. We aim to provide insights into the factors that contribute to malnutrition and identify strategies for improving nutrition among children.

The project includes the following files:

- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its goals, and the files included
- `indicator 2`: This is the csv file that contains all the raw data
- `scripts`: This folder contains the R scripts used to analyze and visualize the data. These scripts use packages such as `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and `dplyr`.
- `Assignment.Rmd`: The R markdown file that contains anarrative
- `output`: This folder contains the output files generated by the R scripts, such as tables, figures, and reports.
- `bar_chart`: This is R script for A bar chartshowing Average BMI value according to gender
- `scatter`: This is R script to Observed BMI value by year
- `time_series`: This is R script of Long-Term Trends in BMI for Children Aged 2-3 Years: 2001-2020
- `world_map`: This is R script for Visualizeing BMI Trends Across the World

To reproduce the analysis, please follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open R Studio and set the working directory to the location where the repository was downloaded.
3. Install the necessary packages by running `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))`.
4. Open the R scripts in the `scripts` folder and run them in the order specified by the filenames (e.g., `01_data_cleaning.R`, `02_data_analysis.R`, etc.).
5. The output files will be generated in the `output` folder.

We hope that this project contributes to the global efforts to end malnutrition and achieve SDG 2. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact us. Thank you for your interest in our project!
